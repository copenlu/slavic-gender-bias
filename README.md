# slavic-gender-bias


Code and data for the EACL 2023 SlavNLP workshop paper "Measuring Gender Bias in West Slavic Language Models".

We're tidying the code and are hoping to put it up as soon as possible.

If you want access to the code beforehand, feel free to [reach out](mailto:ks@di.ku.dk) and we'll be happy to provide it before then.
